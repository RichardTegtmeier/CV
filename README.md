## Academic Experience
Ph.D. Cornell University Plant Breeding, minors: Genomics, Plant Pathology (GPA: 3.70)  
*Expected Graduation: March 2025*  
B.S. Salve Regina University Biology, minor: Music (GPA: 3.63)  

## Research
**Major Goals:** Integrate genomics, transcriptomics, and phenomics to identify novel QTL associated with fire blight (*Erwinia amylovora*) resistance from the primary progenitor species of domesticated apples

 - Identified a novel moderate effect fire blight resistance QTL and developed diagnostic markers
 - Fine mapping the novel fire blight resistance QTL and performing candidate gene selection
 - Developed an image-analysis based leaf disc assay for rapid screening of fire blight resistance in apple and applicable to other relevant perennial tree crops
 - Applied this leaf disc assay to a novel framework for a multi-omic BSA pipeline to accelerate QTL discovery in long-cycle tree crops
